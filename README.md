# Diamondprediction
Searching for a sparkling diamond? 
Selecting a diamond starts by understanding the unique characteristics of each stone. Diamonds are graded based off the 4Cs - cut, colour, clarity and carat weight. 
The 4Cs of diamonds impact the stone’s beauty and value. 
Each of the individual 4Cs of diamonds may interact with one another to impact a stone’s overall appearance.

### Problem statement:
            To predict diamonds prices based on following features.

### About the dataset:

            This data includes information for over 54,000 diamonds, revealing the secrets of their prices and 9 other fascinating attributes. From the carat weight to the diamond's cut, color, and clarity, we'll explore every facet of these precious stones in our quest for knowledge. Let's get started!

### Features :

1. price: price is in US dollars . I have taken this as the target column for analysis. 

2. carat : Weight of a diamond between (0.2 to 5.01)

3. cut : Quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal). The more precise the diamond is cut, the more captivating the diamond is to the eye.  

4.color: Diamond color from J(worst) to D(best)

5.clarity : Measurement of how clear the diamond is (I1 (worst), SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (best))  

6.x : length in mm (0--10.74)

7.y : width in mm (0--58.9)

8. z : depth in mm (0--31.8)

9.depth % : The height of a diamond, measured from the culet to the table, divided by its average girdle diameter. Total depth percentage(43 to 79) = z/mean(x,y) = 2*z/(x+y)

10.table :Width(43 to 95) of the top of diamond relative to widest point

## Data Gathering :
The dataset has  53940 rows  and 10 columns.

## EDA & Feature Engineering :
In this step, we have to analyze the data.
We check for :
            1) checking & handling missing values
            2) identify outliers
            3) remove outliers
            4) encoding of categorical variables
            5) Feature Transformation
            6) Scaling

## Feature Selection / Feature Extraction :
The goal of feature selection techniques in machine learning is to find the best set of features that allows one to build optimized models of studied phenomena.
It helps Improves Model Performance
It helps Optimizes Model Training Time
Feature Selection Methods : 
                        Filter Method      
                        Wrapper Method
                        Embedded Method
